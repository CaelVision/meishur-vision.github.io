Today, the team decided to adapt a new stratergy to counter a problematic issue with the attitude assistance meishur poesseses. Joshua alongwith the consulation of Stephen decided to add a ToF to better estimate the altitude Meishur is at. And the result was a sucess! Heres a sneakpeek to what he had done!
