The team found time to relax and to work on Kite during reading week.
More tests on flight stabilization and GPS navigation were carried out.
Some heading troubles arise but the team is on high spirit to squash the problem.

As shown in the mission log below, Meishur v1 successfully navigated via the designated waypoints, but the heading reference appears to be null while it travels.
This should be avoided because the embedded camera on Meishur v2 need to be pointed towards the transmission tower to run the classification algorithm.
