Hello everyone,

Today we had done our first flight using the off the shelf quadcopter!

TLDR: It was a success, but the system needs ALOT of tuning

The drone (Meishur 1) that we used was installed with the FC, ESCs and other electronics that will be used for the final iteration of the UAV.

You can see the demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTH39-tjn6c">here!</a>

We also got a hold of our parts to create the first iteration of our VTOL UAV!

Stay tuned for more updates, until then, stay meishur my friends!
