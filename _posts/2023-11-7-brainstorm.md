## Drone Drama: Lucas' Glider, Stephen's Shopping Spree, and Joshua, Samuel, and Neil's Safety Circus!

Welcome to the (totally) filler episode of CaelVision's adventures. Today the team went on a mindstorms session to discuss safety procedures, order parts, and pave the path in making CaelVision a reality

## Off to the drone races

Our man Lucas has been on a mission to crack the code of the perfect VTOL glider. Think of it as the superhero of the drone world—taking off and landing with style. He's been juggling designs like a circus performer, and let's just say, there have been more sketches than a bored high school student's notebook. The team's been throwing around ideas like confetti at a party, trying to decide which design takes the cake. Stay tuned for the grand reveal, folks!

While Lucas was busy sketching the future of flight, Stephen was on a shopping spree that would make any tech geek jealous. He's been spec-ing out parts for the test drone like it's a shopping list for the coolest DIY project ever. And guess what? The parts arrived on the same day! It's like Christmas came early for the CaelVision team. Spoiler alert: Stephen might just be the real-life Santa Claus of drone components.

In the midst of all the glider chaos and shopping madness, Joshua, Samuel, and Neil were the unsung heroes working on the safety plan. It's like planning a heist, but instead of stealing, they're making sure no drones go rogue. Joshua and Samuel were in the virtual trenches, creating automated safety gateways to keep the drone in check. Neil, on the other hand, was the logistical mastermind, making sure the weather was on their side and everyone involved was as safe as a kitten in a bubble wrap factory.

So there you have it, folks—the thrilling tale of Lucas' glider adventures, Stephen's tech shopping spree, and the safety circus led by Joshua, Samuel, and Neil. Will the glider soar to new heights? Will the test drone be the stuff of legends? Will the safety plan be more airtight than a vacuum-sealed pickle jar? Stay tuned, because the CaelVision team is taking drone innovation to new heights, and we're all just along for the ride!
