Hello everyone for another update on Meishur 2!

Today we had the oppurtunity to shift all the electronics from the test drone (Meishur 1) onto the Mark build of the VTOL (Meishur 2). <a href="https://youtu.be/o4ad1auHxCY?si=GxXZCy8EErasXnnO

Another update we would like to announce is the daughter board development. Samuel and Joshua had been working these past few days on sourcing and brining up some of the electronics for a daughterboard that is going to be connecting everything together seamlessly. Below is a sneakpeak :)
