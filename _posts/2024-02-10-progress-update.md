Hello everyone for another update on Meishur V1!

Today we had the oppurtunity to shift all the electronics from the test quadcopter frame onto our custom VTOL frame, Meishur. <a href="https://youtu.be/o4ad1auHxCY?si=GxXZCy8EErasXnnO">Here</a> is a video of the latest test we had done.

Another update we would like to announce is the daughter board development. Samuel and Joshua had been working these past few days on sourcing and brining up some of the electronics for a daughterboard that is going to be connecting everything together seamlessly. Below is a sneakpeak :)
