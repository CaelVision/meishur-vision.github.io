We extend a warm welcome to our latest build log update, accompanied by a significant announcement.

The team is proud to unveil our official rebranding as "Kite." As we embark on this new chapter, the steadfast collaboration of our dedicated team members remains unchanged, and together, under the banner of Kite, we are excited to share more about our progress on Meishur! The recent completion of Mark 1 stands as a testament to our commitment and capabilities.

For a visual representation of our progress, please refer to the image below showcasing Meishur Mark 1:

Additionally, we are thrilled to unveil the official team photograph, showcasing the epic saga of our not-so-serious faces and with our (unofficial) sponsor - Fantastic! Wok

In the realm of testing and exploration, we are pleased to report the successful navigation of the test quad from one point to another. While the primary objective has been achieved, the controls team remains engaged in refining the system to ensure stability upon landing and prevent any undesirable "toilet bowl" motion towards the home position.

Stay tuned for more build log updates!
