Team Kite is on the crunch and getting the physical prototype ready for D-Day, AKA the Mechatronics Engineering Symposium.

After all the troubleshooting and schedule conflicts, I'm very proud of the progress we made.
The friendship and team bond is perhaps more important than the engineering exercise and I'm glad to have walked the path with those who care so much for each other.
