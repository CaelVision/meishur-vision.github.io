<h2>The Crafting Guild Unites! Pixelated Progress Report 🌈</h2>

Ahoy, fellow crafters of CaelVision! Today, we unveil the whimsical wonders and pixelated adventures of the past few days in our Minecraft-inspired crafting saga.

<h2>⚙ Gears and Gizmos: A Redstone Odyssey!</h2>

In the enchanted world of crafting, our dynamic duo, Josh and Stephen, have been tirelessly tinkering with the Flight Controls (FCs) and Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs). Through the mystical arts of sensor calibration, they've deciphered the language of the sensors and experimented with various firmware—Ardupilot and Betaflight, to be exact! Behold, as they've successfully connected the motors to the ESC-FC interface, signaling the beginning of a redstone odyssey!

<h2>🔍 Pixelated Vision Quest - Seeking the Missing Blocks</h2>

On the sidelines of our crafting table, Neil and Stephen embark on a pixelated quest to forge the "eyes" of our project—the computer vision realm! Armed with scrolls from the Minecraftian academia, they've chosen the YOLO v4 algorithm to train their models. The crafting duo has even successfully merged the power of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module and the Jetson Nano, thanks to the wisdom gained at the Idea's Clinic. Pixel by pixel, they aim to detect missing insulators in this magical land! Witness the pixelated tapestry woven by our creative tandem! The team shares their journey through the lens of pixel art. It's not just crafting; it's an artistic masterpiece in the making!

<h2>🛠️ GliderCrafters Guild - Soaring into the Pixelated Sky!</h2>

In the heart of our crafting guild, Samuel and Lucas, the master glider crafters, strategize and plan. Blueprints and schematics scatter like enchanted dust as they work towards creating the ultimate glider. The plan? Craft the glider and pass it to Neil, the redstone sorcerer, for a  CFD analysis. Will it soar like a pixelated dragon? Only time will tell!

<h2>🌟 Final Build Countdown: Crafting for the Grand Presentation</h2>

As the Crafting Guild races towards the 20th of November, 2023, they meticulously place each pixel, ensuring all updates align with the grand design. Brace yourselves for a adventure filled with creativity and innovation—the pixelated universe awaits with bated breath!
