Hey there, readers! Welcome back to another round of updates from our dynamic team. We've been buzzing with excitement, and we can't wait to spill the beans on what's been happening behind the scenes.

Our software wizards have been burning the midnight oil, and we're thrilled to report that the test drone is getting some serious TLC. Picture this: sensors being validated, mission control software being put through its paces, and a control system architecture that's so sleek, it practically does a little dance. We've got Stephen and Joshua to thank for that ‚Äì their brainstorming sessions have birthed a flowchart that's so visually pleasing, it might just make your heart skip a beat.

And speaking of heart-skipping moments, Joshua took a deep dive into the ArduPilot universe. Alongside Neil and Stephen, he played motor maestro. It was a symphony of whirring propellers, a harmonious cacophony that echoed through the lab. Testing sensors became an art form, and Joshua wielded his tools with a finesse that would make even the most seasoned tech enthusiasts weak in the knees. The room was alive with the hum of innovation, and every beep and buzz was a note in the masterpiece that is Kite's journey. I mean, just look at what he has done!

Now, let's talk about Neil. This guy has been on a mission ‚Äì a computer vision mission. He stumbled upon RoboFlow, a treasure trove for computer vision enthusiasts. With data from IEEE and Kaggle, he armed himself to the teeth with ceramic insulators (porcelain and glass). After a bit of machine learning magic, Neil unveiled the model predictions ‚Äì not perfect, but hey, we're getting there! It's like teaching a drone to see the world in high definition ‚Äì baby steps, right?

Hold your applause because Lucas is in the spotlight next. This week, he channeled his inner aeronautical genius and crafted a VTOL aircraft that's turning heads (virtually, for now). We're talking meticulous calculations, the best aerofoil in town, and a promise of a CAD design so beautiful, it might just bring a tear to your eye. Unfortunately, you'll have to exercise some patience and wait for our upcoming Final Design Presentations ‚Äì consider it a suspenseful cliffhanger. For now, you can see team Kite in the wee hours of the morning :)

So, dear readers, mark your calendars for November 27th, 2023 ‚Äì the day Kite takes center stage at E7-2409 from 3:30 pm onwards. Trust us; it's going to be a showstopper. We'll see you there, with drones, flowcharts, and aeronautical wonders in tow! Get ready for the future because Kite is soaring to new heights, one drone at a time. Until then, stay curious and keep those propellers spinning! üöÅ‚ú®
